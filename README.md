# transformers_and_attention_mechanism

Practical exercises on Transformers and attention mechanisms, including sentence transformers for Q&A, 
semantic search using OpenAI embeddings, 
and hands-on applications of attention mechanisms. 

Through these exercises, we can develop a deeper understanding of how attention, embeddings, and 
similarity measures work in real-world tasks like text search and question-answering.

# Sentence_Transformers.ipynb 
  This notebook demonstrates how to use sentence transformers for QnA tasks and measuring similarity 
  using cosine similarity.

# Attention_Mechanisms.ipynb
  This notebook introduces the query-key-value framework in NNs to demonstrate how attention mechanisms function.
