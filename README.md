# transformers_and_attention_mechanism

Practical exercises on Transformers and attention mechanisms, including sentence transformers for Q&A, semantic search using OpenAI embeddings, and hands-on applications of attention mechanisms. 
Through these exercises, we can develop a deeper understanding of how attention, embeddings, and similarity measures work in real-world tasks like text search and question-answering.
