# transformers_and_attention_mechanism

Some practical exercises on Transformers and attention mechanisms, including sentence transformers for QnA, semantic search using OpenAI embeddings, and hands-on applications of attention mechanisms. Through these exercises,weâ€™ll develop a deeper understanding of how attention, embeddings, and similarity measures work in real-world tasks like text search and question-answering.
